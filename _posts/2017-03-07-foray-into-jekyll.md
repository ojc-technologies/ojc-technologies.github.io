This is just some placeholder text until I get round to writing something about our first foray into using Jekyll as a replacement for Wordpress etc.

As a software development company and an avid user of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [CommonMark](commonmark.org) it seemed a good fit that we utilise GitHub to write, version control and host our website.
