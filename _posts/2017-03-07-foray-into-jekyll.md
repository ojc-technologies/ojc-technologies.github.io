We've just relanched our website, taking advantage of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as a replacement for traditional content management systems such as Wordpress. Jekyll is a ruby framework that lets you write templates for pages and build nice websites using static Markdown files for your content.

As a software development company and an avid user of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org) it seemed a good fit that we utilise GitHub to write, version control and host our website.

Writing in Markdown allows for not only a nice clean syntax which is easily readable in its [raw form](https://link-to-raw-markdown-file/), but also provides a mechanism to output using [multiple](https://pandoc.org/) [different](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown) [rendering](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) [engines](https://www.markdowntopdf.com/). You can even write and edit on the fly using one of the many [online editors](http://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/).

We think that by using Github for our website, it promotes the sharing and openness of code, resources and processes. Using a Jekyll site in conjunction with github means that others can easily see and learn from the as well as potentially improve them. This openness is dangerous as it ensures that courses are living and breathing things as opposed to a set of notes/problem sheets that sit safely in a drawer somewhere.
